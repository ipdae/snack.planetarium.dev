&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, we are happy to announce that the third minor version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://libplanet.io/&#34;&gt;Libplanet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/releases/tag/0.3.0&#34;&gt;Version 0.3&lt;/a&gt;, has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is a common library that solves game implementation problems such as P2P communication and data synchronization when creating online multiplay games that run on distributed P2P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will cover key changes in Version 0.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;responsive-apis-for-nodes-with-different-versions&#34;&gt;Responsive APIs for Nodes with Different Versions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Version 0.2, we added the &lt;code&gt;appProtocolVersion&lt;/code&gt; parameter on the &lt;code&gt;Swarm&lt;/code&gt; constructor to designate a protocol version to a node.
Now from Version 0.3, you can use the &lt;code&gt;Swarm.DifferentVersionPeerEncountered&lt;/code&gt; event handler to specify the behavior when
encountering nodes with different versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you receive a message from a higher protocol version, you can configure &lt;code&gt;Swarm.DifferentVersionPeerEncountered&lt;/code&gt; so that it requires game app upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;action-rendering-api&#34;&gt;Action Rendering API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, game apps weren&amp;rsquo;t able to receive a signal (event) indicating completion of an action&amp;mdash;specifically, whether or not the execution of an action was reflected in the results of &lt;code&gt;GetStates()&lt;/code&gt; method.
Therefore, in order to ensure that an action for a particular address was processed, you had to use methods like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)&#34;&gt;polling&lt;/a&gt; to determine if the state of the address changed to a post-action state.
Not only was this approach complex and cumbersome to implement, but it also had performance issues because the method needed to check the account states multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, an Action Rendering API has been added in this version.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.3.0/api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html#Libplanet_Action_IAction_Render_Libplanet_Action_IActionContext_Libplanet_Action_IAccountStateDelta_&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IAction.Render()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method allows games to receive an event that reflects the outcome of an action in the local states.
Also, if a block containing a processed action becomes invalid due to a change in the majority chain, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.3.0/api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html#Libplanet_Action_IAction_Unrender_Libplanet_Action_IActionContext_Libplanet_Action_IAccountStateDelta_&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IAction.Unrender()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method allows you to revert an action that has already been rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;improved-accessibility-to-account-states&#34;&gt;Improved Accessibility to Account States&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous versions, we sequentially searched blocks until finding the one with the latest update of the account states.
In this approach, searching for the account states never made required all blocks to be checked starting from the latest address down to the very end.
Additionally, accounts that had not been updated for a long time while new blocks were continuously added on required you to circle lots of blocks,
and the longer the chain length, the longer you had to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this version, we have improved search performance by indexing the blocks with the states of each address when saving,
and directly searching a block when accessing the states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;improved-performance-on-appending-blocks&#34;&gt;Improved Performance on Appending Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation process that follows when adding blocks to the blockchain has been greatly improved on Version 0.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundant validation process when accessing blocks already added to the chain has been removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve moved on from validating the entire chain when adding a block to just validating that specific block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of calculating every time a block hash is required, we now only calculate once when a block is created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve reduced hash calculation time by deriving it from a transaction ID instead of the entire transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple action evaluating process when adding a block has been reduced to once, minimizing overall block adding time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;furthermore&#34;&gt;Furthermore,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about additional changes in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/releases/tag/0.3.0&#34;&gt;our release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know &lt;a href=&#34;https://sprintseoul.org/&#34;&gt;Sprint Seoul&lt;/a&gt; will be held in Gangnam this June 29th (Sat)?
Sprint Seoul is an open source event that gathers people passionate about open source culture and encourages them to contribute codes and/or documents to open source projects.
Even those who are interested in open source but have not been able to contribute can also come to the event and experience their first open source contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint invites both authors and contributors of open source projects to get together and find/resolve issues in a short period of time,
enabling both parties to dive deep into the projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team has already participated in the event last April, and we’re continuing our participation this coming June. We are participating as the leader of &lt;a href=&#34;https://libplanet.io/&#34;&gt;Libplanet&lt;/a&gt; Project, and we look forward to meeting you all at the event to further develop our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications for Sprint Seoul will only be accepted until June 20th, and details of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/DHjbhgpWz9QgzpFo8&#34;&gt;application form&lt;/a&gt; and the event can be found on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sprintseoul.org/&#34;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-project-libplanet&#34;&gt;Introducing Project Libplanet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are curious about Libplanet Project, here&amp;rsquo;s an introduction from &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/04/libplanet-0.2/&#34;&gt;Libplanet 0.2 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is a common library that solves game implementation problems such as
&lt;abbr title=&#34;Peer-to-Peer&#34;&gt;P2P&lt;/abbr&gt; communication and data synchronization
when creating online multiplay games that run on distributed P2P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is now being developed in C# language,
with the aim of being used in conjunction with the popular Unity engine.
Of course, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use Unity,
Libplanet targets &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md&#34;&gt;.NET Standard 2.0&lt;/a&gt; so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use for
games that are implemented on .NET or Mono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of Libplanet is that it is a library,
not an engine or a framework.
Since engines and frameworks control the entry point (&lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; method) of
a process and dictate its execution flow, game programmers have limited control
and can only program essentially through scripts within sections explictly allowed.
Libplanet does not preempt the game process and operates only when it is
explicitly invoked by the game programmer.
This allows Libplanet to function with game engines like Unity without imposing
additional limitations on the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is listed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nuget.org/packages/Libplanet/&#34;&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/&#34;&gt;API docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-a-dev-environment&#34;&gt;Setting Up a Dev Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before participating in Sprint Seoul, you need to install a development environment. As any project will be, setting up an environment takes much longer than people generally anticipate, which unfortunately wastes valuable time. So if possible, &lt;strong&gt;we’d really appreciate it if you could set up an environment prior to the event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Python or JavaScript, C# is a language that is difficult to code without an IDE. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Windows, you can install the latest version of Visual Studio, but we recommend Rider or VS Code which can be used across multiple platforms. The following documents provide instructions in Korean on how to install a development environment for Libplanet, assuming that you are using Rider or Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dahlia/5333634f62509293cd46c0e4ba65b2f5&#34;&gt;Setting the Libplanet Development Environment (VS Code)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dahlia/08f6e659e2266e941ad026f591c30c9a&#34;&gt;Setting the Libplanet Development Environment (Rider)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&#34;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; file in the Libplanet repository guides you through the very basic development environment settings that you develop using only the CLI tool. If you really want to use other editors, please read this file. However, we recommend that you install a well-running environment in advance, since our team may not be able to help you at the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-worth-checking-out&#34;&gt;Issues Worth Checking Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve put together a collection of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&#34;&gt;beginner issues&lt;/a&gt; for first time contributors. These are issues that you can do without going deep and doesn’t require you to know the entire structure of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about what and how to contribute, I think Seunghun&amp;rsquo;s post, &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/05/first-contribution/&#34;&gt;First Contribution to Libplanet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; will certainly help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hyun Seungmin from Planetarium Game-Dev Team. We’ve been preparing a migration to utilize some of the features added or improved on Unity 2018.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nested-prefab&#34;&gt;Nested Prefab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have already been numerous references on the improved workflow thanks to Nested Prefab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Simultaneous Editing&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Previously, teams had to talk prior to fixing each prefab. Otherwise, prefabs fixed by different members from their local storage were bound to crash when uploaded in the upstream storage. However, the new prefab has a way to avoid this conflict by structuring the change points into separate prefabs. Although there is still room for collision between the same prefab, the frequency has significantly decreased due to the smaller category of prefab.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Multiple Structure&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Whereas one prefab was traditionally a single structure that contained all of the objects under it, the new prefab can separate the specific objects under it into another prefab, and the objects under the prefab can be multi-structured to be managed by that prefab. This method allows the prefab to be modularized and reusable, reducing redundancy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Prefab Variant&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You can create a prefab variant by inheriting one prefab while overriding its internal properties or adding components/game objects. This reduces the cost of managing the prefab because changes in the original prefab are reflected on the prefab variant.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Prefab Mode&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Traditionally, creating or modifying a prefab required creating a temporary instance in the scene, modifying it, reflecting it in the prefab, and then erasing the temporary instance again. These required lots of tedious work and there were plenty of room for mistakes in each process. But the newly added prefab mode simplified these workflows to improve dev speed and reliability. Unfortunately, there are still bugs in the prefab mode such as graphic visibility issues, which requires the old way of modification.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-profiler&#34;&gt;Memory Profiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now use enhanced memory profilers to get a more detailed approach to troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2d-animation-v2&#34;&gt;2D Animation v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workflows of Unity’s traditional animation system were so uncomfortable that they needed to be migrated to either the new 2D Animation v2 or an external tool called Spine. Although we ended up using Spine, we were able to see great improvement in 2D Animation v2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;particle-system&#34;&gt;Particle System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because visual effects are extremely important in our project, we aimed for an overall enhancement through the newly improvement Particle System. Despite not making any modifications to the resource, we received positive feedback from our visual arts team on the evident enhancement of visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, a day before our migration, Unity 2019.1 was officially released. So in the following article, we will look at the added features of Unity 2019.1 and talk about how we responded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hyun Seungmin</name><uri>https://github.com/boscohyun</uri><email>seungmin@planetariumhq.com</email></author></entry><entry><title>First Contribution to Libplanet</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/05/first-contribution/" title="First Contribution to Libplanet"/><link rel="alternate" href="https://snack.planetarium.dev/kor/2019/05/first-contribution/" hreflang="ko" title="Libplanet 처음 기여하기"/><id>https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/05/first-contribution/</id><published>2019-05-07T00:00:00&#43;00:00</published><updated>2019-05-07T00:00:00&#43;00:00</updated><content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Seunghun Lee, member of Planetarium Dev Team. I believe one of the reasons why working at Planetarium is so attractive is that I can work as an open source developer. This piece is about my first contribution to Project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet&#34;&gt;Libplanet&lt;/a&gt;. For an introduction to Libplanet, please see &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/04/libplanet-0.2/&#34;&gt;Libplanet 0.2 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-contribute-to-libplanet&#34;&gt;Why did I contribute to Libplanet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Planetarium announced its first recruiting notice and revealed a repository for Project Libplanet. Although I thought it was an attractive project by an impressive team, I was hesitant to apply because Libplanet was being developed in C# to work with Unity (my main expertise was Python). After a brief hesitation, however, I made up my mind to participate in Libplanet anyways because it was an open source project. I decided to participate in basic issues at first and see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c-development-environment&#34;&gt;C# Development Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, I used to mainly develop in Python on Mac. I often contributed to Python open source projects that interested me and this was easy because most Python developers also developed on Mac and were familiar with the open source environment. But as I was about to build a C# development environment on Mac, I found myself stuck from the very first step, unsure about what to install. Fortunately, there were projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mono-project.com/&#34;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core&#34;&gt;.NET Core&lt;/a&gt; that enabled .NET development on Mac, and editors such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; that also supported plug-ins for C# development. So I was able to set up an environment without much difficulty. Now that Libplanet also provides a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&#34;&gt;developer guide&lt;/a&gt;, I think it will be much easier for developers who want to contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-contribute&#34;&gt;What to Contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet’s address uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ethereum.org/&#34;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s address format, which uses a checksum in a combination of upper and lower case letters proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md&#34;&gt;EIP-55&lt;/a&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Hexadecimal&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;0xd1220a0cf47c7b9be7a2e6ba89f429762e7b9adb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;EIP-55 Checksum&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;0xD1220A0cf47c7B9Be7A2E6BA89F429762e7b9aDb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first contributed to Libplanet, the project used hexadecimal consisting of only lowercase letters for its address format. Therefore, this issue had to be implemented so that the address string representation was expressed in the EIP-55 checksum format used by Ethereum. For more information, see the corresponding &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/issues/33&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/pull/43&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I had little development experience and background in C#, it was a simple issue that did not require many modules to be fixed, so I was able to make my first contribution rather easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned-through-my-first-contribution&#34;&gt;What I Learned Through My First Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found out from my first contribution was that the C# development environment on Mac was more easy than I had anticipated. The language itself was not difficult because C# was oriented towards a popularized multi-paradigm programming language. While the .NET development environment on Mac was not too difficult to develop, support for various tools on third-party libraries and non-window platforms was still insufficient. However, this is expected to improve gradually thanks to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s recent open source and multi-platform policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to experience the development culture of Planetarium Team, and it was impressive that all issues were recorded on Github and that members all used English to communicate with the open source community around the world. And since the project was being externally contributed, code reviews were required and management systems like testing and changelogs were being automated and managed through CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on Planetarium for about a month since my first contribution, I’m happy to say that I really enjoy working with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planetarium has participated in events such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://comuka.nonce.community/&#34;&gt;Code-Eating Hippo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sprintseoul.org/&#34;&gt;Sprint Seoul&lt;/a&gt; to promote Libplanet contribution and will continue to actively participate in these events. For those in a similar situation as I was a month ago, there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&#34;&gt;beginners&amp;rsquo; issues&lt;/a&gt; for those wanting to contribute for the first time so please check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

Although there have been several changes,
this article will cover some key feature additions and API changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-libplanet&#34;&gt;Introduction to Libplanet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into our updates, I haven&amp;rsquo;t introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://libplanet.io/&#34;&gt;Libplanet&lt;/a&gt; on this blog,
so let me briefly explain it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is a common library that solves game implementation problems such as
&lt;abbr title=&#34;Peer-to-Peer&#34;&gt;P2P&lt;/abbr&gt; communication and data synchronization
when creating online multiplay games that run on distributed P2P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is now being developed in C# language,
with the aim of being used in conjunction with the popular Unity engine.
Of course, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use Unity,
Libplanet targets &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions/netstandard2.0.md&#34;&gt;.NET Standard 2.0&lt;/a&gt; so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use for
games that are implemented on .NET or Mono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of Libplanet is that it is a library,
not an engine or a framework.
Since engines and frameworks control the entry point (&lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; method) of
a process and dictate its execution flow, game programmers have limited control
and can only program essentially through scripts within sections explictly allowed.
Libplanet does not preempt the game process and operates only when it is
explicitly invoked by the game programmer.
This allows Libplanet to function with game engines like Unity without imposing
additional limitations on the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libplanet is listed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nuget.org/packages/Libplanet/&#34;&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/&#34;&gt;API docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abbr-title-network-address-translation-nat-abbr-traversal&#34;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;Network Address Translation&#34;&gt;NAT&lt;/abbr&gt; Traversal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although P2P communication was possible from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/releases/tag/0.1.0&#34;&gt;Libplanet 0.1&lt;/a&gt;,
all peers had to have a public IP.
In other words, because we couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach peers behind routers,
network communication was actually limited in reality.
Solving this issue was a top priority for us and so
traversing NAT was a major goal in the 0.2 roadmap.
To cover most cases,
we implemented &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5766&#34;&gt;RFC 5766&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389&#34;&gt;RFC 5389&lt;/a&gt;,
called &lt;abbr title=&#34;Traversal Using Relays around NAT&#34;&gt;TURN&lt;/abbr&gt; and
&lt;abbr title=&#34;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT&#34;&gt;STUN&lt;/abbr&gt;.
Also, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any open source C# implementation to ease the process,
so our team&amp;rsquo;s Swen Mun implemented the necessary parts of
the specification from scratch.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Swen&amp;rsquo;s journey, please also read the article,
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/04/nat_traversal_1/&#34;&gt;Moving Beyond NAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;, in which he explains how he solved
this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-game-fitting-transaction&#34;&gt;More Game-fitting Transaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Transaction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a unit that synchronizes data between network members.
Up to the previous version of Libplanet,
we referred to existing technologies such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/&#34;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;
that solve similar problems and took on the concept
that all transactions had a sender and a recipient.
In the case of Bitcoin, it deals with monetary transactions so
the notion that there are senders and recipients in
every transaction comes naturally.
In games, however, there are often actions that do not carry a recipient
concept, such as the movement of a character,
or actions that may have more than one recipient, such as wide range skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to make this transaction more game-fitting,
Libplanet from this version on will dismiss the &lt;code&gt;Sender&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;Recipient&lt;/code&gt; concept of
&lt;code&gt;Transaction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and instead,
replace it with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html#Libplanet_Tx_Transaction_1_Signer&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Signer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Tx.Transaction-1.html#Libplanet_Tx_Transaction_1_UpdatedAddresses&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;UpdatedAddress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-status-access-api&#34;&gt;New Status Access API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, all &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; implementations had to request a set of account
addresses to be accessed within the &lt;code&gt;Execute()&lt;/code&gt; method through
the &lt;code&gt;RequestStates()&lt;/code&gt; method.
Ones that attempted to read or write status of addresses that weren&amp;rsquo;t requested
in advance were treated as invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we came to the conclusion that, since the status shared
in the public network through blockchain could be read anyway,
the limitation on reading didn&amp;rsquo;t mean much, only the limit on updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the duplicated information on the accounts to be accessed
in both the &lt;code&gt;RequestStates()&lt;/code&gt; method and the &lt;code&gt;Execute()&lt;/code&gt; method was bug-prone.
And even if you were careful, fixing the both methods together was a big hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve these problems, the &lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt; interface&amp;rsquo;s status access API
has been greatly improved on this version of Libplanet.
The &lt;code&gt;RequestStates()&lt;/code&gt; method has disappeared altogether,
and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Action.IActionContext.html#Libplanet_Action_IActionContext_PreviousStates&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PreviousStates&lt;/code&gt; property&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Action.IActionContext.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IActionContext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object,
which entered the factor in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.libplanet.io/0.2.1/api/Libplanet.Action.IAction.html#Libplanet_Action_IAction_Execute_Libplanet_Action_IActionContext_&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IAction.Execute()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt;,
now provides a kind of &amp;ldquo;record of changes&amp;rdquo; API.
This &amp;ldquo;record of changes&amp;rdquo; is stacked inside the &lt;code&gt;Execute()&lt;/code&gt; method and
when it finally returns the change history, the status is then updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when a transaction is created, the action is executed in &amp;ldquo;rehearsal mode,&amp;rdquo;
which obtains a set of addresses that the &lt;code&gt;Execute()&lt;/code&gt; method is
trying to update.
The address set is then included in the transaction with a signature.
This prevents a recipient node from changing the account status of addresses
not included in the address set of the signed transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optional-subtype-polymorphism&#34;&gt;Optional Subtype Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to the previous version, the only usage of Libplanet actions was that
each game defines an abstract classs which implements &lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt; and
has multiple concrete classes inheriting it.
But depending on the game, there are cases where it might be better to implement
&lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt; as an only class and select a behavior based on data that goes into
the action than to define multiple types of action at the &lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt; level.
Moreover, some projects might face difficulties because the dynamic dispatcher
for &lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt; types is internally implemented using &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection&#34;&gt;.NET reflection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, from this version of Libplanet, &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Transaction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; needs not only to
implement &lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt; but also to concrete classes.
Abstraction classes or interfaces aren&amp;rsquo;t acceptable
even if they implement &lt;code&gt;IAction&lt;/code&gt;,
and the presence of subtypes is completely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, if you want to select the behavior of an action through
subtype polymorphism, you can use &lt;code&gt;PolymorphicAction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a new action class to
decorate another action.
For example, changing &lt;code&gt;Transaction&amp;lt;AbstractAction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;Transaction&amp;lt;PolymorphicAction&amp;lt;AbstractionAction&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will work as it has been
in most cases.
Of course, the &lt;code&gt;PolymorphicAction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; class uses .NET reflection under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;furthermore&#34;&gt;Furthermore,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lots of other changes on Libplanet 0.2.0, so check them out in
our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/releases/tag/0.2.0&#34;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, two days after the release of &lt;em&gt;0.2.0&lt;/em&gt;, a new version with some
troubleshooting issues is now released, with the latest version being

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Swen Mun from the Planetarium Engineering Team.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about what&amp;rsquo;s known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal&#34;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;Network Address Translation&#34;&gt;NAT&lt;/abbr&gt; traversal techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-s-the-problem&#34;&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From game servers to smartphones, every device connected to the Internet has an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&#34;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;.
This enables devices to connect to one another and send/receive messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with IP address is that quantity is limited.
In the case of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4&#34;&gt;IPv4&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the most widely used protocol, it uses 32-bit addresses which means address space is limited to 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; (more than 4 billion) addresses.
(Of course we don&amp;rsquo;t use all of these addresses.)
This seems enough at first glance, but it&amp;rsquo;s far short of operating more than one device per person on the planet.
In fact, since 2011, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion&#34;&gt;IPv4 addresses have all been exhausted&lt;/a&gt; and no new addresses have been assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6&#34;&gt;IPv6&lt;/a&gt; has been proposed to increase address space to 128-bits, but the supply hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to meet users&amp;rsquo; demand.
Thus, many network operators chose to separate the network and have multiple private IPs, and convert those addresses so that they could access the Internet through one authorized IP.
This method is commonly referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;Network Address Translation&#34;&gt;NAT&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes refers to a device that handles such process (in general, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)&#34;&gt;router&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the server-client model, accessing the Internet through NAT is not a problem.
If the server has an authorized IP, the client can access it, whether through NAT or not.
However, if you need to connect to a device inside the NAT/firewall, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a problem.
Because devices outside NAT cannot access the IP of a private network inside the NAT.
Techniques to address these situations are called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal&#34;&gt;NAT traversal techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-which-technique-do-i-use&#34;&gt;So which technique do I use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abbr-title-universal-plug-and-play-upnp-abbr-abbr-title-internet-gateway-device-protocol-igdp-abbr&#34;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;Universal_Plug_and_Play&#34;&gt;UPnP&lt;/abbr&gt; (&lt;abbr title=&#34;Internet Gateway Device Protocol&#34;&gt;IGDP&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques to pass through NAT can largely be divided into two categories &amp;mdash; whether they are supported by NAT or not.
Protocols such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play&#34;&gt;UPnP&lt;/a&gt; that are proposed to meet the requirements of the modern Internet in which equipment connectivity is valued also addresses NAT passing issues (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol&#34;&gt;Internet Gateway Device Protocol&lt;/a&gt;).
However, this solution can only be applied to equipment that supports UPnP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;relay-abbr-title-traversal-using-relays-around-nat-turn-abbr&#34;&gt;Relay (&lt;abbr title=&#34;Traversal Using Relays around NAT&#34;&gt;TURN&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way around is not getting help from NAT. In other words, this way provides external access while maintaining the private-authorized IP system. How is this possible? At this point, let’s talk about what we can do and can&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For device with an authorized IP,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can process connections from other devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can connect to a device with a different authorized IP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A device with a private IP,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unable to process connection from other devices. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be very precise, it&amp;rsquo;s possible within the same network. But I&amp;rsquo;ll exclude this case to simplify the story. :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can connect to a device that has a different authorized IP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that a server (&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;) with a separate, authorized IP exists outside NAT.
If this server processes the connection instead of the device (let’s call this &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) behind NAT and forwards (relay) the content to &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, then we can handle the connection with confidence without relying on NAT&amp;rsquo;s behavior.
This method is referred to as relay technique and is officially called, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT&#34;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;Traversal Using Relays around NAT&#34;&gt;TURN&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hole-punching&#34;&gt;Hole Punching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to avoid direct help from NAT is by using a technique called &lt;a href=&#34;commonly known as [UDP hole punching] but it is also applicable to TCP&#34;&gt;hole punching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hole Punching also assumes a transit server (&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;) similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT&#34;&gt;TURN&lt;/a&gt;.
However, unlike &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT&#34;&gt;TURN&lt;/a&gt;, the transit server does not directly relay all communications.
Instead, it only passes on NAT&amp;rsquo;s authorized IP and device &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s port information to to device &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;.
In this way when attempting to access &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; attempts to access NAT&amp;rsquo;s authorized IP and port, not &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s private IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although hole punching does not require NAT to implement a specific protocol like UPnP, it does require NAT’s port mapping method.
Specifically, this technique is only applicable to NAT that follows endpoint independent mapping behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-story&#34;&gt;Next Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NAT traversal techniques we have discussed today have different applicable situations and they all have different pros and cons.
Therefore, people in our field use these methods in combination.
Next time we&amp;rsquo;ll look have a closer look on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT&#34;&gt;TURN&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most expensive but the most reliable communication method to move beyond NAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swen Mun</name><uri>https://github.com/longfin</uri><email>swen@planetariumhq.com</email></author></entry><entry><title>Prologue</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/03/beginning/" title="Prologue"/><link rel="alternate" href="https://snack.planetarium.dev/kor/2019/03/beginning/" hreflang="ko" title="시작하며"/><id>https://snack.planetarium.dev/eng/2019/03/beginning/</id><published>2019-03-29T00:00:00&#43;00:00</published><updated>2019-03-29T00:00:00&#43;00:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello World.

&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/&#34;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; revealed itself to the world in 2009, lots of studies and researches have been done on decentralization and blockchain tech. These concepts can be traced back to a specific field in computer science called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing&#34;&gt;distributed computing&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a fairly lengthy history of these technologies, applying them in conjunction with game development process at the blockchain core level often causes difficulties, e.g., direct application of existing research or a lack of implementations in the platforms required for game development.&lt;/p&gt;
